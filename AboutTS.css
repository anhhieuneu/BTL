      <h2>
        THE YALE SCHOOL OF ART IS A GRADUATE SCHOOL THAT CONFERS MASTER OF FINE
        ARTS DEGREES IN GRAPHIC DESIGN, PAINTING PRINTMAKING, PHOTOGRAPHY, AND
        SCULPTURE
      </h2>
      <p>
        Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are
        provided an educational context in which they can explore the potential
        of their own talents in the midst of an intense critical dialogue. This
        dialogue is generated by their peers, by distinguished visitors, and by
        a faculty comprised of professional artists of acknowledged
        accomplishment.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/ảnh/anh12.jpg" style="width: 80%; height: auto;;" alt=""></p>
        <p>The graduate student’s primary educational experience at
        Yale is centered on the student’s own studio activity. Supporting this
        enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from
        rigorous, structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity
        of color, and the rich academic offerings found throughout Yale. Each
        student is routinely exposed to many aesthetic positions through
        encounters with faculty members and visitors. <br /><br />The School is
        devoted not only to the refinement of visual skills, but also to the
        cultivation of the mind. Students must bring creative force and
        imagination to their own development, for these qualities cannot be
        taught—they can only be stimulated and appreciated. The School of Art
        offers an undergraduate art major for students in Yale College (see the
        bulletin Yale College Programs of Study). In addition, the School’s
        courses are open to students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences
        and other professional schools of the University, and School of Art
        students may enroll in elective courses in the Graduate School and other
        professional schools as well as in the College with permission.

        <h2>MASTER OF FINE ARTS DEGREE (MFAS)</h2>
        <p>
          The degree of Master of Fine Arts is the only degree offered by the
          School of Art. It is conferred by the University upon recommendation of
          the faculty after successful completion of all course work in residence
          and after a thesis presentation that has been approved by the faculty.
          It implies distinctive achievement on the part of students in studies in
          the professional area of their choice and demonstrated capacity for
          independent work. The minimum residence requirement is two years. All
          candidates’ work is reviewed by faculty at the end of each term. If the
          work is not considered satisfactory, the student may not be invited back
          to complete the program (see section on Review and Awards under Academic
          Regulations in the chapter General Information). All degree candidates
          are expected to be present at the Commencement exercises in May unless
          excused by the dean. <br /><br />Course work for the Master of Fine Arts
          degree carries a minimum of sixty credits. The disposition of these
          credits varies according to the area of study and is agreed upon at the
          time of registration between the student and the student’s faculty
          adviser.

        <h2>PUBLIC LECTURES AND EXHIBITIONS</h2>
        <p>
          Each department has its own visitors program in which professionals from
          outside the School are invited to lecture to students or take part in
          critiques. <br /><br />The School also facilitates a public all-school
          lecture program, in which ideas of general and cross-disciplinary
          importance are explored by visiting artists and members of the faculty
          in events typically hosted in the evening that are free and open to the
          public. <br /><br />The School of Art’s galleries in Green Hall and EIK
          at 32 Edgewood Avenue provide a year-round forum for the exhibition of
          work by students, faculty, and special guests in the four graduate
          departments of the School and the undergraduate program. Green Gallery
          is open to the public when exhibitions are scheduled, but open hours
          vary by semester. EIK is open during limited hours for specific
          exhibitions and events. Please refer to the Gallery & Publications page
          for more information.
